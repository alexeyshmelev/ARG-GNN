# ARG-GNN

**TreeLoom** learns local ancestry inference (LAI) from ordered collections of complete genealogical trees. Its GNN processes tree structure and follows persistent haplotypes across genomic intervals.

## Current task: execute the benchmark campaign

**Running, but the end-to-end benchmark queue is not complete. Physical GPU 0 only.** Native ARGformer has reached logged batch 740 of 2,135, with its embedding and retrieval stages queued automatically. Six full 30 Mb TRAIN preparation pipelines run on CPUs. TRAIN000 has completed simulation and started shared genealogy inference, while TRAIN001–005 are generating. Waiting alone will not finish the campaign. TreeLoom dispatch, the remaining parents and several competitor integrations still need implementation. No new ancestry comparison is complete. All computation runs on anogena.

The maintained interface is [src/arggnn/benchmarking](src/arggnn/benchmarking). It separates method adapters, biological protocols, observed-only data descriptors, single-GPU scheduling and common scoring. Original author code and immutable experiment records stay in place.

## Inspect the plan

On anogena, inside the dedicated repository:

```bash
source scripts/project_env.sh
export PYTHONPATH=.:src:scripts
.runtime/env/bin/python -B -s -m arggnn.benchmarking methods
.runtime/env/bin/python -B -s -m arggnn.benchmarking paper-recipes
.runtime/env/bin/python -B -s -m arggnn.benchmarking paper-plan ancestralpaths_european
.runtime/env/bin/python -B -s -m arggnn.benchmarking status
```

The new paper plans generate each independent simulation once and share its observations, reference/query panel and frozen evaluation targets across methods. They preserve the native three-source, four-source and six-path tasks separately. Fresh seeds are permitted. The AP generator now supports the paper's 200 Mb length, complete age roster and 170-generation BAA event. Other material publication gaps remain listed in the plan and [recipe notes](docs/paper_benchmark_recipes.md).

These commands inspect small metadata. They do not train models or load scientific datasets. The plan reports missing data products, method constraints and unresolved publication details. The reviewed current worker can run the exact native contrastive job approved by the policy. Other family adapters and dependency barriers remain pending. Historical admissions do not authorize new launches.

## Model advantages and evidence

TreeLoom preserves complete local trees, genomic order and persistent sample identity. The corrected execution path moves learned history into bounded GPU windows and avoids redundant preparation where measured reuse fits. Small FP32 calculation checks passed. Full-size GPU efficiency remains to be measured during the approved campaign.

On eight reused European development simulations, TreeLoom achieved 97.0778 ± 0.5674% modern span accuracy, compared with 94.4461 ± 1.1491% for the released ARGMix pipeline and 93.7830 ± 0.8385% for the derived four-source AncestralPaths endpoint. These are common-data development results with disclosed differences from the publications. TreeLoom-NoMem has higher boundary F1. No overall top-1 claim is established.

Native FLARE has completed the five-parent American comparison. TreeLoom and native ARGformer scores on that same support remain pending. American three-source ancestry and European four-source ancestry are separate protocols. GST is an adapted architecture control rather than a native LAI competitor.

## Frozen benchmark execution

Updated UTC: 2026-10-18T01:01:14.837893+00:00. Physical GPU 0 only.

| Stage | Current verified status |
|---|---|
| Execution | Released by the user. Physical GPU0 only. Exact runnable jobs and dependent stages are in the maintained queue. |
| Native ARGformer | Native ARGformer reached logged training batch 740 of 2,135. Full training is running. Its complete embedding/retrieval chain is armed. |
| Native follow-on | Four complete embedding stages and native retrieval follow genuine contrastive completion through the finite chain. No query truth or ancestry scoring in this chain. |
| Fresh American data | Six CPU generation/inference pipelines running. TRAIN000 generation completed with actual return code 0 and shared genealogy inference started. TRAIN001–005 are generating. Remaining 14 TRAIN / 5 validation / 10 TEST parents are not dispatched. |
| Frozen TreeLoom | Frozen architecture and complete 600-update schedule implemented. Fresh-parent, training-loop and memory-admission tests pass. Full training awaits all 20 complete inputs, fixed focal targets and GPU dispatch integration. |
| European comparisons | Paper recipes and cohort reports encoded. Native sampling, bounded European execution and missing ARGMix settings remain pending. |
| Native FLARE | Previously completed five 30 Mb validation predictions and scores retained below. |

**Native FLARE, five American validation simulations:** accuracy 98.0960 ± 0.3442% and macro F1 97.9196 ± 0.4059%.

| Population | Precision % | Recall % | F1 % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| EUR | 97.3671 ± 0.5621 | 97.7505 ± 0.4517 | 97.5579 ± 0.4452 |
| EAS | 98.5230 ± 0.2364 | 98.6975 ± 0.2639 | 98.6101 ± 0.2463 |
| AFR | 98.2167 ± 0.5343 | 96.9760 ± 1.0077 | 97.5909 ± 0.6883 |

Equal weight per simulation, 10,000 fixed focal records each. SD is across five simulation parents, with ddof 1. VAL000 was previously exposed. This is a common-data development comparison, with no exact publication-table reproduction claimed.
[Complete aggregate](experiments/results/FLARE_original5VAL_aggregate_root02_memo_oct17/FLARE_original5VAL_descriptive_aggregate.json).

The substantial TreeLoom schedule is 20 full 30 Mb TRAIN parents and 30 passes, or 600 complete-parent updates from fresh weights. A disposable one-update check is not representative training. No overall top-1 claim is established.

## Completed comparison

Benchmark execution is approved. Previously completed results remain below. Active training does not yet supply a new ancestry score.

European development panel: eight reused simulation parents. Values are equal-parent means ± sample SD. These common-data results do not establish exact publication reproduction or independent test performance.

| Method | Present-day span accuracy % ↑ | NLL ↓ | Boundary F1 at 1 kb % ↑ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| TreeLoom | **97.0778 ± 0.5674** | **0.088115 ± 0.021993** | 18.3807 ± 1.3141 |
| TreeLoom-NoMem | 97.0000 ± 0.4978 | 0.088541 ± 0.019128 | **19.0488 ± 1.4275** |
| Released ARGMix | 94.4461 ± 1.1491 | 0.219695 ± 0.023975 | 11.7372 ± 1.7328 |
| AncestralPaths, derived C4 | 93.7830 ± 0.8385 | ∞ | 7.0281 ± 0.7779 |

TreeLoom-NoMem removes the persistent sample memory and retains the matched continued-training control. AncestralPaths C4 is an explicit collapse of six native path classes. Native hard calls and raw zero posterior probabilities are retained.

Native FLARE's completed American three-source results appear above. TreeLoom and native ARGformer on the same American support remain pending. GST expanded fitting is not implemented. No new comparative scores are claimed from the running campaign.

## Paper and complete results

The manuscript is a working AAAI draft. Benchmarking is incomplete.

[Working PDF](paper/current_full_panel_working.pdf) · [LaTeX](paper/anchor_kernel_working.tex) · [Overleaf bundle](paper/current_full_panel_overleaf_working.zip)

[Detailed current scores](research/current_scoreboard.json) · [Experiment ledger](research/experiment_ledger.md) · [All recorded metric receipts](research/all_recorded_metric_receipts.json) · [Research history](docs/research_history_before_benchmark_refactor_20261018.md)

Metrics retain their original support, population definitions and provenance. Sample SD across simulations and variation across optimizer seeds are different quantities. The benchmark interface rejects missing evaluation targets and keeps native hard calls and zero probabilities intact.
