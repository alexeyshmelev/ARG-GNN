# ARG-GNN

Graph neural networks for ordered collections of whole genealogical trees, with local ancestry inference from ancestral recombination graphs as the main application. The manuscript uses the AAAI template.

## Main advantages and current evidence

**Current development result: our candidate reaches 84.89% present-day ancestry accuracy. Current-release ARGMix reaches 85.55%.** Our candidate has slightly lower negative log likelihood. Overall superiority and distinct architectural novelty remain research objectives.

Measured advantages in this pilot:

- **Accuracy gains over three controls.** Our age-D2 candidate gains 2.83 percentage points over released AncestralPaths Dense, 4.86 over the GST-style width 32 reconstruction, and 0.71 over the matched GRU.
- **Better likelihood and calibration than ARGMix in this development run.** Present-day NLL is 0.4273 versus 0.4353. The same 15-bin calibration ECE is 0.0323 versus 0.0861. ARGMix has higher accuracy and a better present-day Brier score. These observations need independent confirmation.
- **Small learned model.** The candidate has 10,420 parameters, versus 28,308 for the matched GRU and 43,300 for GST32. Parameter count is 63.2% lower than the GRU. Training speed and memory improvements have not been measured for the new compact implementation.

Method features:

- **Whole-tree geometry.** The evaluated candidate derives interactions from complete connected marginal trees, including internal ancestors and all 280 sampled haplotypes. Its learned node features currently come from the sampled leaves. All 3,718 original inferred trees are represented.
- **Ordered genomic context.** It exchanges information across trees using genomic order and physical interval lengths, and tracks the same sampled haplotypes across neighboring trees. Reference evidence uses all 96 pure-source references, with 184 query/context states and 120 scored outputs.
- **Biological constraints under development.** A separate census-cut prototype adds a neural upward/downward whole-tree encoder and retention based on changing sample-clade membership. Older references remain ancestry proxies. This prototype has source/CPU checks, but its native integration and predictive benefit are still being evaluated. It is separate from the candidate reported below.

## Comparison with existing methods

Completed development results as of 2026-10-10. **Higher accuracy is better. Lower NLL, Brier and ECE are better.** Primary results concern 64 present-day query haplotypes.

† AncestralPaths NLL, Brier and ECE use a disclosed auxiliary stable-logit evaluation with unchanged trained weights and identical class predictions. Its original raw probability underflow and infinite NLL are preserved in the experiment records. No probability floor is applied.

Metrics: accuracy is the fraction of correctly assigned query base pairs. NLL is negative log probability of the true class, in nats. Brier is the sum of squared errors across the four class probabilities. ECE measures the confidence-versus-accuracy gap in 15 equally spaced confidence bins. Scores weight exact physical query support and average parent-level values. GST32 has the lowest ECE in this pilot, despite its lower accuracy. Calibration alone does not establish better ancestry inference.

**Against our strongest current comparator:** the age-D2 candidate trails ARGMix by 0.66 accuracy percentage points. Age and plain candidates differ by only 0.05 points. Neither age conditioning nor overall superiority is established by this pilot.

Other query strata, using the same selected models:

| Query group | Candidate accuracy | ARGMix accuracy | Candidate NLL | ARGMix NLL |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Ancient queries, 56 haplotypes | 88.45% | 89.33% | 0.3263 | 0.3433 |
| All queries, 120 haplotypes | 86.55% | 87.32% | 0.3801 | 0.3924 |

### What these comparisons mean

The common task is four-source ancestry, ANA/CHG/WHG/EHG, at census 350 generations. Data comprise four independent 2 Mb simulation parents, split into two TRAIN and two VAL parents before extraction. Each parent has 96 pure references, 64 unlabeled mixed-context haplotypes and 120 queries, including 64 present-day and 56 ancient queries. All methods are scored on identical observed physical coverage and query identities. Accuracy, NLL and Brier weight exact class-span intersections within 100 bp bins, then average the two parent scores equally.

These are validation results used during model development and checkpoint selection. **No final TEST results or statistical superiority claim are reported.** Optimizer seeds are not independent biological replicates. Candidate seeds 202/303 and seven mechanism controls are still running on physical GPUs 2/3.

Baseline fidelity:

- **ARGMix:** current author implementation at commit `c2481248`, with its native model, objective, checkpoint selection, refinement and overlap averaging retained. This is a common-task transfer. The available release differs from the April preprint, so this table is not its numerical reproduction.
- **AncestralPaths:** released TensorFlow Dense model, preserving its native features and six path outputs, followed by a disclosed six-path-to-four-source probability mapping. The paper's unspecified CNN is not reproduced by this released Dense baseline.
- **GST:** independently reconstructed Graph Set Transformer style controls adapted to per-query ancestry outputs. These rows are architectural controls, not executions of the authors' implementation.
- **ARGformer:** native training and retrieval ran on Relate trees. That export does not preserve shared internal ancestor IDs across trees, which ARGformer requires. Its ranking is withheld while the documented tsinfer/tsdate inference family is prepared. Shared ancestry IDs will not be fabricated from local numbering or matching clades.

Input features, supervision, native selection rules and post-processing differ between methods and are disclosed in the [baseline fidelity policy](docs/biological_baseline_fidelity_v1.md). Matched scoring support provides a common endpoint, rather than an exact reproduction of each paper's original dataset and pipeline.

## Environment and contributions

The project runs on anogena in `/workspace-SR003.nfs2/ARG-GNN`. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before contributing. Source `scripts/project_env.sh` before installing packages or running Python. The main environment is `.runtime/env`. Runtime state, datasets and checkpoints stay on the server and are excluded from Git.

Run `.runtime/env/bin/python scripts/update_research_ledger.py` after new results. Record a hypothesis or explicit repeat reason before each substantive experiment. Preserve complete outcomes, provenance and failures, and push concise conclusions regularly.

The next scientific checks are qualified ARGformer inputs, completed optimizer/mechanism comparisons, independent simulation-parent confirmation, demographic shifts and a justified real-data endpoint. Published ancestry paintings are comparator outputs, rather than ground truth.
